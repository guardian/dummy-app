    <p>This is a dummy application.  The bad news is that it does very little for you.  The good news is that it is
    working.</p>

    <p>This application has a <a href="@routes.Application.manifest()">manifest</a> and
        <a href="@routes.Application.healthcheck()">healthcheck</a> pages in their expected locations.  Which means it can be
    deployed.</p>
